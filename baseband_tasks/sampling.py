class ShiftAndResample(Convolve):
    r"""Shift and optionally resample a stream in time.

    The shift is added to the sample times, and the stream is optionally
    resampled to ensure a sample falls on the given offset.

    If the shift corresponds to a time delay, and the signal was recorded
    after mixing, the phases should be adjusted, which can be done by
    passing in the local oscillator frequency. For an upper sideband, the
    phase correction is,

    .. math:: \phi = - \tau f_{lo}.

    For the lower sideband, the rotation is in the opposite direction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ih : task or `baseband` stream reader
        Input data stream, with time as the first axis.
    shift : float, float array-like, or `~astropy.units.Quantity`
        Amount by which to shift samples in time, as (float) samples, or a
        quantity with units of time.  Should broadcast to the sample shape.
    offset : float, `~astropy.units.Quantity`, or `~astropy.time.Time`
        Offset that the output stream should include. Can be an absolute
        time, or a (float) number of samples or time offset relative to the
        start of the underlying stream.  The default of `None` implies that
        the output stream is free to adjust.  Hence, if a single shift is
        given, all that will happen is a change in ``start_time``. To
        ensure the grid stays fixed, pass in ``0``.
    whence : {0, 1, 2, 'start', 'current', or 'end'}, optional
        Like regular seek, the offset is taken to be from the start if
        ``whence=0`` (default), from the current position if 1, and from the
        end if 2.  One can alternativey use 'start', 'current', or 'end' for
        0, 1, or 2, respectively.  Ignored if ``offset`` is a time.
    lo : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, or `None`, optional
        Local oscillator frequency.  Should be passed in when the signal was
        mixed down before sampling and the shift should be interpreted as a
        time delay (rather than a clock correction). For raw data, this can
        usually just be ``if.frequency``.  But for channelized data, the
        actual frequency needs to be passed in.  If data were recorded
        without mixing (like for CHIME), no phase correction is necessary
        and one should pass in `None`.  Default: `None`.
    pad : int, optional
        Padding to apply on each side when shifting data. This sets the size
        of the sinc function which which the data is convolved (see below).
        Numerical tests suggest that with the default of 64, the accuracy
        is better than 0.1%.
    samples_per_frame : int, optional
        Number of resampled samples which should be produced in one go.
        The number of input samples used will be larger by ``2*pad+1``.
        If not given, works on the larger of the samples per frame from
        If not given, the larger of the sampler per frame in the underlying
        stream or 14 times the padding (to ensure ~87.5% efficiency).

    Notes
    -----
    The precision of the shifting and resampling is controlled by ``pad``,
    as it sets the length of the response, which consists of a sinc function
    combined with a Hann window,

    .. math:: R(x) &= {\rm sinc}(x-s) \cos^2(\pi(x-s)/L),\\
                 -{\rm pad} &\le x \le {\rm pad},\quad L = 2{\rm pad} + 2

    Here, :math:`s` is the fractional pixel offset.  Note that :math:`L`
    is chosen such that :math:`R(\pm{\rm pad})` is still non-zero.

    The convolution is done in the Fourier domain, and the Hann window,
    combined with with the padding done when reading, ensures there is no
    aliasing between the front and the back of each frame.  There is,
    however, aliasing near the Nyquist frequency. For most recorded signals,
    this will not be important, as the band-pass filter will likely have
    ensured there is very little signal near the band edges.  For
    channelized data, however, it may be more problematic and some
    pre-filtering stage may be necessary.
