class Integrate(BaseTaskBase):
    """Integrate a stream stepwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ih : task or `baseband` stream reader
        Input data stream, with time as the first axis.
    step : int or `~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
        Interval over which to integrate.  For time invervals, should have
        units of time.  For phase intervals, units should be consistent with
        what the ``phase`` callable returns.  If no ``phase`` callable is
        passed in, then if step is integer, it is taken to be a number of
        samples in the underlying stream that should be integrated over,
        and if step is omitted, integration is over all samples.
    phase : callable
        Should return full pulse phase (i.e., including cycle count) for given
        input times (passed in as `~astropy.time.Time`).  The output should be
        compatible with ``step``, i.e., generally an `~astropy.units.Quantity`
        with angular units.
    start : `~astropy.time.Time` or int, optional
        Time or offset at which to start the integration. If an offset or if
        ``step`` is integer, the actual start time will the underlying sample
        time nearest to the requested one.  Default: 0 (start of stream).
    average : bool, optional
        Whether the output should be the average of all entries that
        contributed to it, or rather the sum, in a structured array that holds
        both ``'data'`` and ``'count'`` items.
    samples_per_frame : int, optional
        Number of samples to process in one go.  This can be used to optimize
        the process.  With many samples per bin, the default of 1 should be OK.
    dtype : `~numpy.dtype`, optional
        Output dtype.  Generally, the default of the dtype of the underlying
        stream is good enough, but can be used to increase precision.  Note
        that if ``average=True``, it is the user's responsibilty to pass in
        a structured dtype.

    Notes
    -----
    If there are not many samples per bin, either set ``samples_per_frame``
    to a larger number or ensure that ``samples_per_frame`` of the underlying
    stream is not small (larger than, say, 20). If both are small, there will
    be a relatively large overhead in calculating phases.

    Since time or phase bins are typically not an integer multiple of the
    underlying bin spacing, the integrated samples will generally not contain
    the same number of samples.  The actual number of samples is counted, and
    for ``average=True``, the sums have been divided by these counts, with bins
    with no points set to ``NaN``.  For ``average=False``, the arrays returned
    by ``read`` are structured arrays with ``data`` and ``count`` fields.
